Arclava Music strives to promote and record cutting edge artists in the field of ultra-rock. Arclava's secondary goal is to educate the world on what ultra-rock is and isn't. In articles enclosed, you'll learn how to tune your guitar to ultra-rock tuning, and how to use ultra-rock in any musical style whether it's rock and roll, pop, folk, country, jazz and/or classical.

Our current roster of artists include Nova Casanova, The Singing Bees, and Grady Franklin.
